<h3>Part 1: the <tt>git</tt> revision control system</h3>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>
	The base code of Nori is provided as a <tt>git</tt> repository. <tt>git</tt>
	is the most widespread distributed version control system in use today—it is a good
	idea to familiarize yourself with this system if you've never used it before.
</p>
<p>
	Traditionally, a <em>version control system</em> (VCS) allows a team of
	people to collaboratively edit a repository of files. Multiple people might
	happen to work on the same file, and the job of the VCS is to track the
	(potentially conflicting) modifications and merge them into an unambiguous
	repository state that is usable to the rest of the team. These systems
	(e.g. CVS, SVN) store the authoritative repository state in a central
	repository server. Any changes must be <em>committed</em> to this server so
	that other team members can access them.
</p>
<p>
	A <em>distributed version control system</em> (DVCS) is conceptually
	similar: multiple people can collaborate, and there is usually a central
	repository server. The main difference is that there is nothing special
	about this server: anyone with sufficient permissions can copy the entire
	repository state including history data using an operation referred to as
	<em>cloning</em>. From that point on, the local copy acts as a full-fledged
	repository server that works without a network connection to the central
	server. Users can inspect the history of files and even commit new changes,
	which are stored in the local copy. To allow another user to see these
	changes, they can either be <em>pushed</em> to that user's DVCS server, or
		they can be pushed to a central server and then <em>pulled</em> by the
		recipient. There are many providers (such as <a
	 href="http://www.github.com">github</a> or <a
  href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>) which offer free repository
  hosting for open source projects. Because there is nothing special about the
  central server, it's easy to switch providers, and anyone can start their own
  version of an existing repository (this is referred to as <em>forking</em>).

<p>
<h4>Why <tt>git</tt>?</h4>
You may wonder why we use <tt>git</tt> in this course given that students are
expected to work on their own. There are multiple good reasons to use it even
for a single-user workflow:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The <tt>git diff</tt> feature lets you see what changes you made since the
		last commit and commit messages provide additional context. This
		information is extremely useful when debugging programs that don't work
		as expected.
		This assumes that you will commit every logical change as a commit with
		a descriptive commit message (e.g. "Added a new light source type;
		implementation of interface to come next").
	</li>
	<li>
		The <tt>git branch</tt> feature makes it easy to try out some large
		modifications to your code and switch back and forth. It's easy to undo
		these changes and start from scratch if things don't work out. In
		general, it's good practice to start a new <em>feature branch</em> for
		every major feature (e.g. area light support or multiple importance
		sampling). Once the feature is fully realized and bug-free, it can be
		merged into the main branch. You'll have to implement multiple features
		for the final project, and it's a good idea to temporarily separate
		them from each other in this way.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may stumble across a bug in your code and wonder when it was introduced.
		The <tt>git bisect</tt> feature lets you quickly find the offending commit.
	</li>
	<li>
        As the semester progresses, we will push out a number of additions to
        the Nori framework. You can simply <tt>merge</tt> our new revisions
        into your repository to benefit from these improvements.
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
	<h3>Cloning using the command line</h3>
	<p>
		The source code of Nori is available on <a
		href="https://github.com/wjakob/nori">github</a>.
		To check out a copy of the source code, enter
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ git clone --recursive
	https://github.com/wjakob/nori</pre>
	<p>
		on the terminal. The <tt>--recursive</tt> flags ensures
		that all dependency libraries are cloned as well.
		We'll likely publish extensions and bug-fixes to this
		repository as the semester progresses. To get them, 
		navigate into the <tt>nori</tt>directory and run the command
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ git pull</pre>
		If there were any concurrent modifications to the same file,
		<tt>git</tt> may ask you to resolve merge conflicts. We refer you to
		the learning resources for information about resolving conflicts in
		general.

<h3>Part 2: Setting up a C++ compiler and building the base code</h3>

	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h3>Linux / Mac OS X</h3>
		<p>
		Begin by installing the
		<a href="http://www.cmake.org/download/">CMake</a> build system on your
		system. On Mac OS X, you will also need to install a reasonably
		up-to-date version of XCode along with the command line tools.
		On Linux, any reasonably recent version of GCC or Clang will work.
		Navigate to the Nori folder, create a build directory and start <tt>cmake-gui</tt>, like so:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ cd path-to-nori
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake-gui ..</pre>

					Set the build type to "Unix Makefiles"
					and then press the <em>Configure</em>
					and <em>Generate</em> buttons.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		After the Makefiles are generated, simply run
		<tt>make</tt> to compile all dependencies and Nori itself.
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ make -j 4</pre>
		This can take quite a while; the above command compiles with four
		processors at the same time. Note that you will probably see many
		warning messages while the dependencies are compiled—you can ignore
		them.

	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h3>Windows / Visual Studio 2013</h3>
		<p>
		Begin by installing Visual Studio 2013 (older versions won't do) and a

	</div>
</div>
<div class="row col-md-12">
	Let's begin with a brief overview of the most important dependencies:
</div>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
		<h4>Eigen</h4>
		<p>
			When developing any kind of graphics-related software, it's
			important to be familiar with the core mathematics support library
			that is responsible for basic linear algebra types, such as vectors,
			points, normals, and linear transformations. Nori uses
			<a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen 3</a> for this
			purpose. We don't expect you to understand the inner workings of
			this library but recommend that you at least take a look at the
			helpful <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox">tutorial</a> 
			provided on the Eigen web page.

			<p>
				Nori provides a set of linear algebra types that are
				derived from Eigen's matrix/vector class (see e.g. the header file 
				<tt>include/nori/vector.h</tt>). This is necessary
				because we will be handling various quantities that
				require different treatment when undergoing homogeneous
				coordinate transformations, and in particular we must
				distinguish between positions, vectors, and normals.

				The main subset of types that you will most likely use are:
				<ul>
					<li><tt>Point2i</tt>,</li>
					<li><tt>Point2f</tt>,</li>
					<li><tt>Point3f</tt>,</li>
					<li><tt>Vector2i</tt>,</li>
					<li><tt>Vector2f</tt>,</li>
					<li><tt>Vector3f</tt>, and</li>
					<li><tt>Normal3f</tt>.</li>
				</ul>
				where the number indicates the dimension and the
				subsequent character denotes the underlying scalar
				type (i.e. integer or single precision floating point).
			</p>
		</p>
		<h4>pugixml</h4>
		<p>
			The <a href="http://pugixml.org/">pugixml</a> library implements a tiny XML parser that we use to
			load Nori scenes. The format of these scenes is described below.
			The XML parser is fully implemented for your convenience, but
			you may have to change it if you wish to extend the file format
			for your final project.
		</p>
		<h4>pcg32</h4>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.pcg-random.org">PCG</a> is a family of tiny
			pseudorandom number generators with good performance that was
			recently proposed by Melissa O'Neill. The full implementation of
			<tt>pcg32</tt> (one member of this family) is provided in a single
			header file in <tt>ext/pcg32/pcg32.h</tt>. You will be using this
			class as a source of pseudo-randomness starting with the second
			programming assignment on sample generation.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
		<h4>Hypothesis test support library</h4>
		<p>
			With each programming assignment, we will provide statistical
			hypothesis tests that you can use to verify that your algorithms
			are implemented correctly. You can think of them as unit tests with
			a little extra twist: suppose that the correct result of a certain
			computation in a is given by a constant \(c\). A normal unit test
			would check that the actual computed \(c'\) satisfies
			\(|c-c'|&lt;\varepsilon\) for some small constant \(\varepsilon\) to
			allow for rounding errors etc. However, rendering algorithms usually employ
			randomness (they are <em>Monte Carlo</em> algorithms), and in practice
			the computed answer \(c'\) can be quite different from \(c\), which
			makes it tricky to choose a suitable constant \(\varepsilon\).
		</p>
		<p>
			A statistical hypothesis test, on the other hand, analyzes the
			computed value and an estimate of its variance and tries to assess
			how likely it is that the difference \(|c-c'|\) is due to random
			noise or an actual implementation bug. When it is extremely unlikely
			(usually \(p&lt;0.001\)) that the error could be attributed to noise, the test
			reports a failure.
		</p>
		<h4>OpenEXR</h4>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.openexr.com/">OpenEXR</a> is a standardized file format for storing high dynamic
			range images. It was originally developed by Industrial Light and
			Magic and is now widely used in the movie industry and for
			rendering in general. The directory <tt>ext/openexr</tt> contains
			the open source reference implementation of this standard. You will
			probably not be using this library directly but through Nori's
			<tt>Bitmap</tt> class implemented in <tt>src/bitmap.cpp</tt> and
			<tt>include/nori/bitmap.h</tt> to load and write OpenEXR files.
		</p>
		<h4>NanoGUI</h4>
		<p>
			The <a href="https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui">NanoGUI</a> library
			creates an OpenGL window and provides a small set of user interface
			elements (buttons, sliders, etc.). We use it to show the preview of
			the image being rendered. This library could be useful if your
			final project involves some kind of user interaction.
		</p>
		<h4>Intel Thread Building Blocks</h4>
		<p>
			The <tt>tbb</tt> directory contains <a href="https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Intel's Thread
				Building Blocks</a>. This is a library for parallelizing
			various kinds of programs similar in spirit to OpenMP and Grand
			Central Dispatch on Mac OS. You will see in the course that
			renderings often require significant amounts of computation, but
			this computation is easy to parallelize. We use TBB because it is
			more portable and flexible than the aforementioned
			platform-specific solutions. The basic rendering loop in Nori (in
			<tt>src/main.cpp</tt>) is already parallelized, so you will
			probably not have to read up on this library unless you plan to
			parallelize a custom algorithm for your final project.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
		<h3>Scene file format and parsing</h3>
		<p>
			Take a moment to browse through the header files in
			<tt>include/nori</tt>. You will generally find all important
			interfaces and their documentation in this place. Most headers
			files also have a corresponding <tt>.cpp</tt> implementation file
			in the <tt>src</tt> directory.

			The most important class is called <tt>NoriObject</tt>—it is
			the base class of everything that can be constructed using the XML
			scene description language. Other interfaces (e.g. <tt>Camera</tt>)
			derive from this class and expose additional more specific
			functionality (e.g. to generate an outgoing ray from a camera).
		</p>

		<p>
			Nori uses a very simple XML-based scene description language, which
			can be interpreted as a kind of building plan: the parser creates
			the scene step by step as it reads the scene file from top to
			bottom. The XML tags in this document are interpreted as requests
			to construct certain C++ objects including information on how to
			put them together.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each XML tag is either an <em>object</em> or a <em>property</em>. Objects
			correspond to C++ instances that will be allocated on the heap. Properties are
			small bits of information that are passed to an object at the time of its
			instantiation.

			For instance, the following snippet creates red diffuse BSDF:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-xml">
&lt;bsdf type="diffuse"&gt;
    &lt;color name="albedo" value="0.5, 0, 0"/&gt;
&lt;/bsdf&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			Here, the <tt>&lt;bsdf&gt;</tt> tag will cause the
			creation of an object of type <tt>BSDF</tt>, and the
			<tt>type</tt> attribute specifies what specific subclass
			of <tt>BSDF</tt> should be used.
			The <tt>&lt;color&gt;</tt> tag creates a property of name <tt>albedo</tt>
			that will be passed to its constructor.
			If you open up the C++ source file <tt>src/diffuse.cpp</tt>, you will see that 
			there is a constructor, which looks for 
			<span rel="tooltip" title="Or alternatively substitutes 50% grey when no value is provided.">this specific property</span>:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Diffuse(const PropertyList &amp;propList) {
    m_albedo = propList.getColor("albedo", Color3f(0.5f));
}</pre>
		<p>
			The piece of code that associates the
			<tt>"diffuse"</tt> XML identifier with the <tt>Diffuse</tt>
			class in the C++ code is a macro found at the bottom of the file:
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
NORI_REGISTER_CLASS(Diffuse, "diffuse");</pre>

		<p>
			Certain objects can be nested hierarchically. For
			example, the following XML snippet creates a mesh that loads its
			contents from an external OBJ file and assigns a red diffuse BRDF
			to it.
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-xml">
&lt;mesh type="obj"&gt;
    &lt;string type="filename" value="bunny.obj"/&gt;

    &lt;bsdf type="diffuse"&gt;
        &lt;color name="albedo" value="0.5, 0, 0"/&gt;
    &lt;/bsdf&gt;
&lt;/mesh&gt;
</pre>
		<p>
			Implementation-wise, this kind of nesting will cause a method named
			<tt>addChild()</tt> to be invoked within the parent object. In this
			specific example, this means that <tt>Mesh::addChild()</tt> is
			called, which roughly looks as follows:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
void Mesh::addChild(NoriObject *obj) {
    switch (obj->getClassType()) {
        case EBSDF:
            if (m_bsdf)
                throw NoriException(
                    "Mesh: multiple BSDFs are not allowed!");
            /// Store pointer to BSDF in local instance
            m_bsdf = static_cast&lt;BSDF *&gt;(obj);
            break;
    // ..(omitted)..
}
</pre>
			This function verifies that the nested object is a BSDF, and that no BSDF was specified
			before; otherwise, it throws an exception of type <tt>NoriException</tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following different types of properties can currently be passed to 
			objects within the XML description language:
		</p>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;!-- Basic parameter types --&gt;
&lt;string name="property name" value="arbitrary string"/&gt;
&lt;boolean name="property name" value="true/false"/&gt;
&lt;float name="property name" value="float value"/&gt;
&lt;integer name="property name" value="integer value"/&gt;
&lt;vector name="property name" value="x, y, z"/&gt;
&lt;point name="property name" value="x, y, z"/&gt;
&lt;color name="property name" value="r, g, b"/&gt;</pre>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;!-- Linear transformations use a different syntax --&gt;
&lt;transform name="property name"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Any sequence of the following operations: --&gt;
    &lt;translate value="x, y, z"/&gt;
    &lt;scale value="x, y, z"/&gt;
    &lt;rotate axis="x, y, z" angle="deg."/&gt;
    &lt;!-- Useful for cameras and spot lights: --&gt;
    &lt;lookat origin="x,y,z" target="x,y,z" up="x,y,z"/&gt;
&lt;/transform&gt;</pre>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>
			The top-level element of any scene file is usually a
			<tt>&lt;scene&gt;</tt> tag, but this is not always the
			case.
			For instance, some of the programming assignments will ask you to
			run statistical tests on BRDF models or rendering algorithms, and
			these tests are also specified using the XML scene description
			language, like so:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-xml">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

&lt;test type="chi2test"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Run a χ<sup>2</sup> test on the microfacet BRDF model (@ 0.01 significance level) --&gt;
    &lt;float name="significanceLevel" value="0.01"/&gt;

    &lt;bsdf type="microfacet"&gt;
        &lt;float name="alpha" value="0.1"/&gt;
    &lt;/bsdf&gt;
&lt;/test&gt;</pre>
		
		<h3>Creating your first Nori class</h3>
		<p>
			In Nori, rendering algorithms are referred to as <em>integrators</em>
			because they generally solve a numerical integration problem. The remainder
			of this section explains how to create your first (dummy) integrator which
			visualizes the surface normals of objects.
		</p>
		<p>
			We begin by creating a new Nori object subclass in <tt>src/normals.cpp</tt> with
			the following content:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-cpp">
#include &lt;nori/integrator.h&gt;

NORI_NAMESPACE_BEGIN

class NormalIntegrator : public Integrator {
public:
    NormalIntegrator(const PropertyList &amp;props) {
        m_myProperty = props.getString("myProperty");
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Parameter value was : " &lt;&lt; m_myProperty &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    /// Compute the radiance value for a given ray. Just return green here
    Color3f Li(const Scene *scene, Sampler *sampler, const Ray3f &amp;ray) const {
        return Color3f(0, 1, 0);
    }

    /// Return a human-readable description for debugging purposes
    std::string toString() const {
        return tfm::format(
            "NormalIntegrator[\n"
            "  myProperty = \"%s\"\n"
            "]",
            m_myProperty
        );
    }
protected:
    std::string m_myProperty;
};

NORI_REGISTER_CLASS(NormalIntegrator, "normals");
NORI_NAMESPACE_END</pre>
		To try out this integrator, we first need to add it to the CMake build system:
		for this, open <tt>CMakeLists.txt</tt> and look for the command
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-bash">add_executable(nori,
  # Header files
  include/nori/bbox.h
  ...

  # Source code files
  src/bitmap.cpp
  ...
)</pre>
		<p>
		Add the line <tt>src/normals.cpp</tt> at the end of the source file
		list and recompile. If everything goes well, CMake will create an
		executable named <tt>nori</tt> (or <tt>nori.exe</tt> on Windows) which
		you can call on the command line.
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally, create a small test scene with the following content and save it as <tt>test.xml</tt>:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-xml">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

&lt;scene&gt;
    &lt;integrator type="normals"&gt;
        &lt;string name="myProperty" value="Hello!"/&gt;
    &lt;/integrator&gt;

    &lt;camera type="perspective"/&gt;
&lt;/scene&gt;
</pre>
<p>
		This file instantiates our integrator and creates the default camera
		setup. Running <tt>nori</tt> with this scene causes two things to
		happen:

Rendering .. done. (took 93.0ms)
Writing a 1280x720 OpenEXR file to "test.exr"
</pre>
The Nori executable echoed the property value we provided, and 
it printed a brief human-readable summary of the scene.
The rendered scene is saved as an OpenEXR file named <tt>test.exr</tt>.

		<h4>Visualizing OpenEXR files</h4>
		<p>
		A word of caution: various tools for visualizing OpenEXR images exist,
		but not all really do what one would expect. Adobe Photoshop and the <a
	  href="https://bitbucket.org/edgarv/hdritools/downloads">HDRITools</a> by
  Edgar Velázquez-Armendáriz work correctly, but <tt>Preview.app</tt> on Mac OS
  for instance tonemaps these files in an awkward and unclear way.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		If in doubt, you can also use Nori as an OpenEXR viewer: simply run it with an EXR file as parameter, like so:
		</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ ./nori test.exr
</pre>
		<h4>Tracing rays</h4>
		<p>
		Let's now build a more interesting integrator which traces some rays against the scene geometry. Change the file <tt>normals.cpp</tt> as shown on the left side. Invoke <tt>nori</tt> on the file <tt>scenes/pa1/bunny.xml</tt>, and you should get the image on the right. Please submit the resulting EXR file with the first programming assignment solutions to receive credit for making it all the way through the tutorial.
