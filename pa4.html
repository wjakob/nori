    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this assignment, you will develop a rendering algorithm that
        combines several previously unused architectural components of Nori
        (Emitters, BSDFs) to compute the illumination integral discussed in
        class. We will only focus on <em>direct</em> illumination for now (i.e.
        light which has interacted with at most one material) and leave
        <em>indirect</em> illumination for the next assignment. In the last
        part of the assignment, you will also add a new BSDF model for
        refractive materials ("dielectrics").
    </p>
    <p>
        As usual, begin by importing the latest base code updates into your
        repository by running
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
git pull https://github.com/wjakob/nori
</pre>
    <p>
        If there were any concurrent changes to the same file, you
        may have to perform a <em>merge</em> (see the git tutorials under
        "Preliminaries" for more information).

    <h4>Fast BVH</h4>
    <p>
    As promised, we're also providing you with an optimized Bounding Volume Hierarchy for fast ray-intersection computations. To use it (which is entirely optional), download <a href="//rgl.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/wjakob/2017/03/13/accel.zip"><tt>accel.zip</tt></a>, and overwrite your version of <code>src/accel.cpp</code> and <code>include/nori/accel.h</code> files with the contents of the ZIP file. Naturally, you may also continue using your own acceleration data structure.

    <h3>1. Area lights (30 pts)</h3>
    <p>
        Our first goal will be to extend Nori so that any geometric object can
        be turned into a light source known as an <em>area light</em>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
    <img src="images/bunny.png" style="max-width:150px">
    </p>
    <p>
        Each
        triangle of a mesh that is marked as an area light uniformly emits
        radiance towards all directions above its surface. In Nori's XML
        description language, area lights are specified using a nested
        <tt>emitter</tt> tag of type <tt>area</tt>. Here is an example:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-xml">
&lt;scene&gt;
    &lt;!-- Load a OBJ file named "bunny.obj" --&gt;
    &lt;mesh type="obj"&gt;
        &lt;string name="filename" value="bunny.obj"/&gt;

        &lt;!-- Turn the mesh into an area light source --&gt;
        &lt;emitter type="area"&gt;
            &lt;!-- Assign a uniform radiance of 1 W/m<sup>2</sup>sr --&gt;
            &lt;color name="radiance" value="1, 1, 1"/&gt;
        &lt;/emitter&gt;
    &lt;/mesh&gt;

    &lt;!-- ..... --&gt;
&lt;/scene&gt;</pre>
    <p>Currently, Nori won't be able to understand the above snippet since
    area lights are not yet implemented.
    To add area lights to Nori, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>

        <li>Create a new class <code>AreaLight</code> in a file named
            <code>src/area.cpp</code> that derives from the
            <code>Emitter</code> class. Connect it to the scene parser using
            the <code>NORI_*</code> macros similar to the
            <code>Integrator</code>s you have previously created. Use the constructor's
            <code>const PropertyList &amp;</code> argument to extract the <code>radiance</code>
            parameter in the constructor.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> The Monte Carlo rendering technique in part 2 of this
            assignment requires the ability to sample points that are uniformly
            distributed on area lights. Currently, none of this functionality
            exists.
            </p>
            <p>
            Begin by familiarizing yourself with the <code>Mesh</code> class to see how
            vertices, faces and normals are stored. Next, add a method that
            uniformly samples positions on the surface associated with a
            specific <code>Mesh</code> instance.
            The name and precise interface of this method are completely up to you.
            However, we suggest that it should take a uniformly 2D sample and return
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The sampled position \(\mathbb{p}\) on the surface of the mesh</li>
                <li>The interpolated surface normal \(\mathbb{n}\) at
                    \(\mathbb{p}\) computed from the per-vertex normals. When the
                    mesh does not provide per-vertex normals, compute and return
                    the face normal instead.</li>
                <li>The probability density of the sample. This should be the reciprocal
                    of the surface area of the entire mesh.<br/><br/></li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            You may find the <code>DiscretePDF</code> class useful to implement the sampling step. We suggest that you use this class to build a discrete probability distribution that will allow you to pick a triangle proportional to its surface area. Once a triangle is chosen, you can (uniformly) sample a barycentric coordinate \((\alpha, \beta, 1-\alpha-\beta)\) using the mapping
            \[
            \begin{pmatrix}
            \alpha\\
            \beta
            \end{pmatrix}
            \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
            1 - \sqrt{1 - \xi_1}\\
            \xi_2\, \sqrt{1 - \xi_1}
            \end{pmatrix}
            \]
            where \(\xi_1\) and \(\xi_2\) are uniform variates.
        </li>

        The precomputation to build the discrete probability distribution can be performed in the <code>activate()</code> method of the <code>Mesh</code> class, which is automatically invoked by
        the XML parser.
    </ol>


    <h3>2. Distribution Ray Tracing (30 pts)</h3>
		<p>
            In this part you will implement a new direct illumination
            integrator, which integrates the incident radiance by sampling
            points on a set of emitters (a.k.a. light sources).

            Emitters can be fully, partially or not at all visible from a point
            in your scene, hence you will need to perform Monte Carlo
            integration to compute the reflected radiance while accounting for
            visibility.

                        sources. Note the presence of smooth shadows below the

        <p>
            Recall the <em>Reflection Equation</em> discussed in class, which expresses the reflected
            radiance due to incident illumination from all directions as an integral over the unit hemisphere centered at \(\mathbf{x}\):
			\[
                \newcommand{\vx}{\mathbf{x}}
                \newcommand{\vc}{\mathbf{c}}
                \newcommand{\vy}{\mathbf{y}}
                \newcommand{\vn}{\mathbf{n}}
                L_r(\vx,\omega_r) = \int_{\mathcal{H}^2} f_r (\vx,\omega_i,\omega_r)\,L_i (\vx,\omega_i)  \cos\theta_i\, \mathrm{d}\omega_i.
			\]
            We'll now put together all of the pieces to approximate this
            integral using Monte Carlo sampling.
        </p>
        <p>

            Begin by taking a look at the
            <code>BSDF</code> class in Nori, which is an abstract
            interface for materials representing the \(f_r\) term in the above
            equation. Evaluating \(f_r\) entails a call to the
            <code>BSDF::eval()</code> function, while sampling and probability
            evaluation are realized using the <code>BSDF::sample()</code> and
            <code>BSDF::pdf()</code> methods. All methods take a special
            <code>BRDFQueryRecord</code> as argument, which stores
            relevant quantities in a convenient data structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this assignment, we will only consider <em>direct</em>
            illumination, which means that \(L_i(\vx,\omega_i)\) is zero almost
            everywhere except for rays that happen to hit an area light source.
            A correct but naïve way of evaluating this integral would be to
            uniformly sample a direction on the hemisphere and then check if it
            leads to an intersection with a light source.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, doing so would be extremely inefficient: light sources generally only
            occupy a tiny area on the hemisphere, hence most samples would be wasted, causing
            the algorithm to produce unusably noisy and unconverged images.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will thus use a better strategy with a higher chance of success:
            instead of sampling directions on the hemisphere and checking if
            they hit a light source, we will directly sample points on the
            light sources and then check if they are visible as seen from
            \(\vx\). Conceptually, this means that we will integrate over the light source surfaces \(\mathcal{L}\) instead of the hemisphere \(\mathcal{H}^2\):
			\[
                \newcommand{\vr}{\mathbf{r}}
                L_r(\vx,\omega_r) = \int_{\mathcal{L}} f_r (\vx,\vx\to\vy,\omega_r)\,L_e (\vy,\vy\to\vx) \, \mathrm{d} \vy?? \qquad(\text{warning: this is not (yet) correct})
			\]
        </p>
        <p>
        Here \(\mathbf{x}\to\mathbf{y}\) refers to the normalized direction from \(\mathbf{x}\) to \(\mathbf{y}\), and \(L_e(\vx,\omega)\) is the amount of emitted radiance at position \(\vx\) into direction \(\omega\).
        The integral above motivates the algorithm, but it is not correct:
        since we changed the integration variable from the solid angle domain
        to positions, there should be a matching change of variables factor
        that accounts for this (this is not unlike switching from polar coordinates
        to a Cartesian coordinate system).

        In our case, this change of variable factor is known as the <em>geometric term</em>:
        \[
            G(\vx\leftrightarrow\vy) :=V(\vx\leftrightarrow\vy)\frac{
            |\vn_\vx \cdot(\vx\to\vy)|\,\cdot\,
            |\vn_\vy \cdot(\vy\to\vx)|}{\|\vx-\vy\|^2}
        \]
        </p>
        <p>
        The first
term \(V(\vx\leftrightarrow\vy)\) is the visibility function, which is \(1\) or \(0\) if the
two points are mutually visible or invisible, respectively. The numerator contains the
absolute value of two dot products that correspond to the familiar cosine foreshortening factors
at both \(\vx\) and \(\vy\). The denominator is the inverse square falloff that we already observed
when rendering with point lights. The \("\leftrightarrow"\) notation expresses that the function is symmetric with respect to its arguments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given the geometric term, we can now write down the final form of the reflection equation
            defined as an integral over surfaces:
			\[
                \newcommand{\vr}{\mathbf{r}}
                L_r(\vx,\omega_r) = \int_{\mathcal{L}} f_r (\vx,\vx\to\vy,\omega_r)\,G(\vx\leftrightarrow\vy)\,L_e (\vy,\vy\to\vx)\, \mathrm{d} \vy
			\]
			Note that the cosine factor in the original integral is absorbed by one of the dot products
            the geometric term.
        To implement distribution ray tracing in Nori, follow these steps:
		</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new integrator <code>src/whitted.cpp</code> (the name will become clear later)<br/><br/></li>
            <li>The integrator should begin by finding the first surface interaction \(\vx\) visible along the ray passed to the <code>Li()</code> function. This part works just like in the <code>simple.cpp</code> integrator.
                What this step does is to apply the ray tracing operator \(\vr(\vc, \omega_c)\) to convert reflected radiance at surfaces into incident radiance at the camera \(\vc\):
	\[
		L_i(\vc,\omega_c)=L_r(\vr(\vc, \omega_c), -\omega_c).
	\]
                </li>
            <li>
                <p>
        Given \(\vx\), the distribution ray tracer should then approximate the above integral by sampling a
        <em>single</em> position \(\vy\in\mathcal{L}\) and then returning the body of the integral,
        i.e.
\[
f_r (\vx,\vx\to\vy,\omega_r)\,G(\vx\leftrightarrow\vy)\,L_e (\vy,\vy\to\vx)
\]
<em>divided</em> by the probability of the sample \(\vy\) per unit area.
However, this will require a few extra pieces of functionality.
</p>
<p>
                Take a look at the <code>Emitter</code> interface. It is almost completely empty. Clearly, some mechanism for sample generation, evaluation of probabilities, and for returning the emitted radiance is needed.
        As before, we don't explicitly specify an API that
		you should use to implement the sampling and evaluation operations for
		emitters—finding suitable abstractions is part of the exercise.
		That said, you can look at the <code>BSDF</code> definitions in
		<tt>include/nori/bsdf.h</tt> to get a rough idea as to
		how one might get started with such an interface.

    <p>
        Take a look at the file <code>src/mirror.cpp</code>, which defines BSDF
        of a perfect mirror based on a <em>Dirac delta function</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Complete the template in <code>src/dielectric.cpp</code> to implement
        the <code>sample()</code> method for a dielectric (i.e. refractive)
        BSDF based on Snell's law and the Fresnel equations discussed in class.
        Note that while the <tt>mirror</tt> sampling code is completely
        deterministic, the <tt>dielectric</tt> BSDF should use the supplied
        random sample to choose between a reflection (proportional to the
        amount of reflection) and a refraction event (proportional to the
        amount of refraction).
    </p>
    <p>
        One potential gotcha: when we discussed specular BRDFs in class, they
        involved a division by a cosine factor to cancel out a corresponding
        term from the reflection integral equation. Due to the convention used
        by implementations of the <code>BSDF::sample</code> interface (see
        <code>include/nori/bsdf.h</code> for details), this division is not
        needed in Nori.
        Specifically, any BRDFs that require a cosine factor in the reflection
        integral should multiply by it in <code>sample()</code>, while specular
        materials simply omit this step.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Whitted-style ray tracing (10 pts)</h3>
    <p>
        The final step of this assignment involves extending the distribution
        ray tracer to turn it into a <em>Whitted</em>-style ray tracer (named after Turner Whitted) that
        is able to account for specular reflections and refractions.

        Modify <code>src/whitted.cpp</code> as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the surface position \(\vx\) is determined, check if the
            material is specular or diffuse (via <code>BSDF::isDiffuse()</code>).
            In the latter situation, simply fall back to your previous implementation.
            The specular case is treated specially: instead of sampling a
            position on a light source, invoke the specular surface's <code>BSDF::sample()</code>
            method to generate a refracted direction.
            Note that the BSDF of an intersection <tt>its</tt> can be obtained using the expression <code>its.mesh->getBSDF()</code>.
            This will produce a sampling weight \(c\) and a new direction \(\omega_r\).<br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            Request an additional random number \(\xi\) from the sampler
            and then return the following radiance estimate from your
            rendering algorithm's <code>Li()</code> method:
            \[
            L_i(\vc, \omega_c) = \begin{cases}
            \frac{1}{0.95}c L_i(\vx, \omega_r),&\text{if $\xi < 0.95$}\\
           0,&\text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
            \]
            Note that this recursion continous for as long as the reflected or refracted rays hit specular surfaces. It ends when a diffuse surface is found where a single emitter sampling step is performed using part 2 of this assignment.
            The trick involving the random number \(\xi\) is used to prevent the
            algorithm from getting stuck in an infinite sequences of refraction and reflection events and will be
            discussed in more detail later in class.
        </li>
