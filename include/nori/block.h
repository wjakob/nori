/**
 * \brief Weighted pixel storage for a rectangular subregion of an image
 *
 * This class implements storage for a rectangular subregion of a
 * larger image that is being rendered. For each pixel, it records color
 * values along with a weight that specifies the accumulated influence of
 * nearby samples on the pixel (according to the used reconstruction filter).
 *
 * When rendering with filters, the samples in a rectangular
 * region will generally also contribute to pixels just outside of 
 * this region. For that reason, this class also stores information about
 * a small border region around the rectangle, whose size depends on the
 * properties of the reconstruction filter.
